# Tar Heel Letters
Tar Heel Letters is a simple web app made in collaboration with the UNC Center for Literacy and Disability Studies. It simplifies the process of typing and forming words for those with mental and/or physical impairments.
# Usage
The application employs two buttons for the purpose of entering new characters, helping to limit degrees of freedom and simplify its use.
The "Next Letter" button which appears on the left will progress to the next letter alphabetically, while the "Write It" button will add the current character to the message box. Using a combination of these two choices, the user can write any desired sequence of alphabetic characters.
# Additional Features
Tar Heel Letters includes additional features located as buttons below the letter display. The user is able to have the application verbally recite or print the previously added letters.
The settings menu is currently being created and will give users the ability to change aspects of the application's display and functionality.
